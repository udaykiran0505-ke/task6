Objective
Implement KNN from scikit-learn

Normalize features and explore distance-based classification

Experiment with different values of K

Evaluate model performance and visualize decision boundaries

Tools & Libraries Used
Python

Pandas

NumPy

Scikit-learn

Matplotlib / Seaborn

Dataset
Recommended: Iris Dataset


Example: Iris Dataset with 150 samples and 3 classes.

Implementation Steps
Data Loading and Exploration

Load dataset using Pandas

Explore class distribution and features

Feature Normalization

Apply MinMaxScaler or StandardScaler to normalize input features

Explain why normalization is essential in KNN

Model Training

Use KNeighborsClassifier from sklearn.neighbors

Train with different k values (e.g., k=3, 5, 7)

Use Euclidean distance (default)

Model Evaluation

Evaluate using accuracy score, confusion matrix

Optionally compute precision, recall, F1-score

Visualization

Plot decision boundaries using a 2D feature projection

Compare how decision boundaries vary with different k values

Results
K Value	Accuracy
3	xx.xx%
5	yy.yy%
7	zz.zz%

Best performing value of K: k = <X>

Observations: e.g., higher K reduces overfitting but may lead to underfitting

Concepts Explored
Instance-based learning

Distance metrics (Euclidean)

Importance of feature scaling

K selection and model tuning

KNN time complexity and sensitivity to noise
